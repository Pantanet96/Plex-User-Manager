## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A Plex Media Server
- Plex Pass (required for sharing libraries)
- Plex Authentication Token ([How to find your token](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/))

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pantanet96/Plex-User-Manager.git
   cd Plex-User-Manager
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**
   - Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Linux/Mac:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   python init_db.py
   ```
   This creates the SQLite database and default users.

## Configuration

1. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the web interface**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
   - Login with default credentials:
     - **Admin**: `admin` / `Admin123!`
     - **Moderator**: `moderator` / `Mod123!`
     - **Auditor**: `auditor` / `Audit123!`

3. **Configure Plex settings**
   - Go to Settings
   - Enter your Plex Server URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:32400`)
   - Enter your Plex Authentication Token
   - Click "Save Settings"

4. **Sync with Plex**
   - Go to Dashboard
   - Click "Sync with Plex" to import users and libraries

## Multi-User & Roles

The application supports three distinct user roles:

1. **Admin** 🔴
   - Full access to all features
   - Manage application settings (Plex connection, Scheduler)
   - Manage users (Create, Edit, Delete)
   - View and download logs

2. **Moderator** 🔵
   - Manage Plex libraries and user access
   - Sync with Plex
   - Cannot access Settings or User Management

3. **Auditor** ⚪
   - Read-only access to Dashboard and Logs
   - Cannot make any changes

## Usage

### Managing User Access

1. Click on "Manage Access" for any user in the dashboard
2. Select which libraries the user should have access to
3. Optionally set start and expiration dates
4. Click "Save Changes"

**Note**: The "Default" library is always assigned and cannot be removed to prevent user removal from the server.

### Scheduled Access

- Set a **Start Date** to grant access beginning at a specific time
- Set an **Expiration Date** to automatically revoke access after a certain date
- Leave dates empty for immediate and permanent access
- The background scheduler automatically applies date-based changes

### Scheduler Configuration

You can customize how often the scheduler runs:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Scheduler Configuration**
3. Choose between two modes:
   - **Interval Mode**: Run every X minutes (5-1440 minutes)
   - **Daily Mode**: Run once per day at a specific time (e.g., 03:00)
4. Click **Save Settings**

The scheduler will automatically reconfigure without requiring an app restart.

### Manual Scheduler Trigger


For testing purposes, you can manually trigger the scheduler:
1. Go to Settings
2. Scroll to "Debug Tools"
3. Click "Run Scheduler Now"

### Log Management

View and monitor application logs directly from the Settings page:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Application Logs**
3. Select log file:
   - **Application Logs**: All application activity (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
   - **Error Logs**: Only error messages
4. Filter by log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
5. Adjust number of lines to display (10-1000)
6. Enable/disable auto-refresh (updates every 5 seconds)
7. Download complete log files for offline analysis

**Log Rotation**: Log files are automatically rotated when they reach 10MB, keeping the last 5 backup files (50MB total per log type).

### Server Configuration

Configure server port and HTTPS settings from the Settings page:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Server Configuration**
3. Configure options:
   - **Server Port**: Change the default port (5000) to any port between 1024-65535
   - **Enable HTTPS**: Toggle HTTPS support
   - **SSL Certificate Type**:
     - **Self-signed**: Automatically generates a self-signed certificate (for development/testing)
     - **Custom Certificate**: Upload your own `.crt` and `.key` files (for production)
4. Click **Save Server Settings**
5. Click **Restart Server** to apply changes

**Important Notes**:
- Port and HTTPS changes require a server restart to take effect
- Self-signed certificates will show browser warnings (normal for development)
- For production, use valid SSL certificates from a trusted CA
- In Docker deployments, the restart button triggers a container restart (requires `restart: unless-stopped` policy)

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: Before deploying to production:

1. **Change the default admin password**
   - The default credentials (`admin`/`admin`) should be changed immediately
   - New passwords must meet security requirements:
     - Minimum 8 characters
     - At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
     - At least one number (0-9)
     - At least one special character (!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>_-+=[]\/;~`)

2. **Update the SECRET_KEY**
   - In `app.py`, replace `your_secret_key_here` with a secure random key:
     ```python
     import secrets
     print(secrets.token_hex(32))
     ```

3. **SSL/TLS Configuration**
   - The application currently disables SSL verification for Plex connections
   - For production, implement proper SSL certificate handling

4. **Use a production WSGI server**
   - Don't use Flask's development server in production
   - Consider using Gunicorn, uWSGI, or similar

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Scheduler**: APScheduler
- **Plex Integration**: PlexAPI
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Glassmorphism design), Vanilla JavaScript

## Troubleshooting

### Plex Connection Issues

If you encounter SSL certificate errors:
- The application is configured to bypass SSL verification for local Plex servers
- Check that your Plex Server URL and Token are correct in Settings

### Scheduler Not Running

- Check the countdown timer on the dashboard
- Manually trigger the scheduler from Settings > Debug Tools
- Check `app.log` for error messages

### Database Issues

If you need to reset the database:
```bash
rm plex_manager.db
python init_db.py
```
